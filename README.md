### Problems, which i got when i worked with VirtualBox

1.  I can't copy any text from vB (*Virtual Box*) on Windows 
> When i tried to download guestAddition i got blue screen.
 It was when i tried work with .iso file on Windows and downloaded
 guestAddition(there was a problem downloading mouse files).
 But i decided this problem when downloaded that from linux terminal!:)
 I thinked so... but i started getting endless warnings from vB
 such as **"vboxclient failure waiting for event verr invalid handle..."**
 and i ununstalled guestAddition:(i worked with this site 
[установка гостевых дополнений](https://pc.ru/articles/ustanovka-gostevyx-dopolnenij-virtualbox)
2. Sometimes Firefox loses internet connection

### Important commands

    touch [name_file] #Create a new file
    nano [name_file] #Open file for editing
    cat [name_file] #See content of file
    apt install [name_package] #Download files
    sudo #Get roots
